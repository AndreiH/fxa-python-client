fxa-python-client
=================

Python sample code to access Firefox Account (FxA) APIs, run by the server in
https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server . This is most useful for running
automated tests, and as supplemental documentation of the protocol.

The source tree also contains a tool to create test vectors for the FxA auth
protocol.
